This mobile app uses the Face.com API to recognize missing people or wanted criminals upon taking a 
photo via the mobile device's camera. This prototype has been tested with photos of my own face only. 
The API is not that smart and needs lots of training images in various conditions to recognize a face. 
Ideal conditions would include snapping photos of a person in an unvarying position, such as in an 
airport security line.

Future extension(s): real-time video face recognition
